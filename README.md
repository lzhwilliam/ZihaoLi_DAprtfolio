# Data-Analytics-Portfolio
This is the repository of collection of Zihao Li's data analytics projects. most of the projects are done by the purpose of academic, self-learning, and hobby, and presented in the form of python notebook, R markdown file, CSS, HTML, or published on the server(POWER BI, TABLEAU, etc) 

## Instructions for running python notebooks
-- download python notebooks, run in jupyter notebook, VSCode, or Google Colab. 

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning Project

  - Bank Campaign Analysis and Prediction ([PYTHON](https://github.com/williamLIZIHAO/Data-Analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Campaign%20Analysis%20and%20Prediction%20(%20PYTHON%20)/Bank_marketing_campaigns.ipynb)) ([R]()): the purpose of this project is to find useful insights from exploring features and find most suitable machine learning method for prediction. Used 2 types of machine learning methods, linear and tree. compared their parameters side-by-side to determine which method is the best method for prediction

  - [Fraud detection for Bank](https://github.com/lzhwilliam/ZihaoLi_DAprtfolio/blob/main/Bank%20Fraud%20detection%20(%20PYTHON%20)/bank_fruad_detection_with_grid_search.ipynb): the purpose is to find the appropriate machine learning model for bank to detect fraud actions. used 7 different of machine learning model, compared their performance metric side-by-side, and determine which is the better one to go with.

  - [Time Serise analysis](https://github.com/lzhwilliam/ZihaoLi_DAprtfolio/blob/main/Time%20Serise%20Analysis%20On%20Stock%20Market%20Data%20(%20Python%20)/stock_prediction.ipynb): Built a Recurrent Neural Network model that used to do time-serise analysis on the price of a stock. Created different network layers; examed accuracy through loss function and visual plot.

  - [Data related position's salary prediction](https://github.com/lzhwilliam/ZihaoLi_DAprtfolio/blob/main/Data%20Science%20Job%20Salaries%20Prediction%20And%20Analysis%20(%20PYTHON%20)/Data_Science_Job_Salaries_supervised_machine_learning.ipynb): examined features that have or may have affects on salary of a person that's working in a data-related position. created diffenert regression model to determine which is the best regarding prediction power. eventually, determined which factor have high effections on their salary.


- ### SQL Project

  - [San Francisco area criminal dataset analysis](https://github.com/lzhwilliam/ZihaoLi_DAprtfolio/blob/main/San%20Francisco%20Crime%20Dataset%20Analysis%20using%20PySpark%20(%20PYTHON%20)/SF%20crime%20analysis.ipynb): Utilized San Francisco governemnt collected dataset about chronical record of crime in every district. Imported into Databrick; utilized PySpark and SQL to extract and transfrom data to build visulizations for analysis.
